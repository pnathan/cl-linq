cl-linq

An attempt to provide simple and easy to use & remember access to data
functions in Common Lisp. Microsoft's wildly popular LINQ system is
taken as the basis for this effort, along with a healthy dose of SQL.

In general, the list and vector types should work.


It should be noted that this library does not provide anything that
Common Lisp does not itself provide in its standard function
set.. However, several years of experience puttering with datasets and
Common Lisp have distinctly demonstrated to the original author that
better was demanded.
